Also, i can see libvirt fails before i see the black screen with a cursor. what do i do? where do i even look? Should I just reinstall arch? I have a different partition for home directory, so I am not worried about data loss.\\n   Comments:\\n- The more answer i try to find on forums, the worse it gets\"\n",

Maybe you'd be happier using another de.\\n     - It's not like that, I wanted to configure it but I just want some starter things.\\n          - What I've done over the years is I've tried a few tiling window managers and somewhere in my collection of USB thumb drives and CD/DVD ROMS, I've got pretty much all of the configuration files basically setup so I can use them from the get-go. Meaning, my terminal application is set to open with super+Enter and my file manager (which I probably need to change) opens with super+shift+enter. Those are really the 2 main things I need on any system to work. I usually install vim (which runs in a terminal) so, those 3 programs and I can get any system setup and running. So, basically a terminal application i have to have. Without it, I'm dead in the water. Pretty much we all need a terminal program for any system. Especially something like Arch and Gentoo...\\n- End-4, but there is no escape from config files lil guy\\n     - Tysm Yess ik but just something to start with\\n- Ml4w(my Linux for work)is good starter dot files look it up it\\u2019s on GitHub and has an aur repo\\n     - Tysm\\n- honestly just grab chris titus tech's dotfiles or ml4w's hyprland setup - both are pretty solid starting points and save you from the config hell. ml4w especially has a nice installer script that does most of the heavy lifting for you just remember to backup your current setup first in case you want to switch back to gnome later\\n     - Tysm\\n- If you also want to support the project: https://account.hypr.land, if not pick what vibes with you, because nothing is perfect, you will tweak it regardless, so just pick something close\\n     - Okk tysm \\ud83d\\ude0a\\n- Linutil has a starter config\\n- Google has the best dot files\\n- With twin babies at home, ricing hyprland was downright impossible. I've used ML4W dotfiles and tweaked a few things, very minor things, to my liking. Edit: typo\\n     - Tysm\"\n",

Note: I am new in linux and only tried zorin os\\n   Comments:\\n- both methods are detailed in the Arch Wiki [Manual Installation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) [ArchInstall](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Archinstall)\\n- Both\\n- there is no advantage to using arch as a beginner. keep using distributions aimed at newbies like: * Linux Mint, MX Linux, Ultramarine Linux, Zorin OS Core there is no harm in them. things work and work fast and this is fantastic. for some reason arch is a meme and treated differently than it is, as if it represented some kind of advantage or achievement. and none of this exists. over time, the longer you use Linux, the more advanced distributions will make sense and eventually you will choose the one that best suits you... and of course, arch may well suit you in the future. but not now. at the beginning of the journey it\\u2019s not worth it. you need to use linux to know it, use it. _o/\\n- RTFM /s In the installation guide is the manual mode\\n- Go to Arch Wiki instead of asking here!\\n- rtfm\\n- When in doubt, the wiki has pretty much all possible configurations. The wiki is one of the reasons why the Arch became such a huge distro.\\n- CachyOS is an Arch variant that has a fantastic installer. I would recommend it for new users. A lot of things just work out of the box that takes a skilled Linux user hours to get right after install. Things like BTRFS and automatic snapshots, thermal control, fan control, graphics drivers\\u2026 I\\u2019ve installed and used Arch for years.\"\n",
